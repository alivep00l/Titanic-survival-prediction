#Titanic Survival Prediction

##Overview

This project focuses on predicting the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning algorithms. The dataset includes various features such as passenger class, age, sex, fare, and more, which are used to determine the likelihood of survival.

##Dataset Description

The dataset used for this project contains the following columns:
PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger
Survived: Survival indicator (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
Pclass: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
Name: Name of the passenger
Sex: Gender of the passenger
Age: Age of the passenger
SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
Parch: Number of parents/children aboard
